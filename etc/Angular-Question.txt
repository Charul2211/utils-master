- Differnce betweeen Angular & angular 4.  // javascript base - typescript base/  controller concept - Component based UI Approch. -Routing.when /@routeconfig for routing.
- What is Angular - Signle page app. - Typescript based, open sourc framework, develop/maintained by google/ component/services based.
- What is lazy loading? 
- How would you optimize angular?
- Angular Lifecycle hook
- Promise & Observable
- @viewchildren & @viewChild. :It provides a reference to elements or components in your view:
- What is pipe?
- What is event?
- What is services? - allow you to define code that"s accessible and reusable throughout multiple components. / communicate with a backend of some sort to send and receive data
- Differnce betweeen services & factory?
- Tree shaking?
- What is event Emitter? how it's works? used by components and directives to emit custom events
- What is Traceur compiler? -Converted es66 into Javascript - Browser understand te javscript
- Type Directive and Directives  - Structure Directive and Attribute directive -->  Directive is use to design re-usable components
- What is custom directive?
- What is Data binding?   - String Interpolation, Property Binding, Event Binding, and Two Way Data Binding.
- Bilding blocks of angular.
- Differnce betweeen Angular Expression and Javascript Expression. - They can write the inside tag- do not support loop exception. 
- What is Route Outlet? directive from the router library.
- What is Angular Universal?
- How to Shared the Data between Component ? Using @Input and @output. @input --Parent to child using property binding, child to parent using custom event binding.
- What is the Difference betweeen AOT and JIT. - produce Typescript code to Javascript code bind HTML form javascript run in brower, AOT- run time error compaile.
- What is Ng-Content? tag as a placeholder for that dynamic content, then when the template is parsed Angular will replace that placeholder tag with your content
- What is View Encapsulation? View encapsulation defines whether the template and styles defined within the component can affect the whole application or vice versa - Native / Emulated.
- What is the observable, subscribe, Observer, Subject, oparator, Schedular
		- Observable: Observable is a stream of events or data.
		- subscribe : represents the execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for cancelling the execution.
		- Observer: is a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable.
		- Operators: are pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like map, filter, concat, flatMap, etc.
		- Subject: is the equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers.
		- Schedulers: are centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens on e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame or others.
- Ng Container / Ng Template / ngTemplateOutlet
- Template Reference Variable and @viewChild.
- Why Provide IN : Root? If it is never used it will not be contained in the build (tree shaked). / If the service is only used within a lazy loaded module it will be lazy loaded with that module
- How to analyze the Bundle Size? : ng build --prod --stats-json / npm install webpack-bundle-analyzer -D

- Difference betweeen CanActive / CanLoad. ==> canActivate is used to prevent an unauthorized user / canLoad is used to prevent the entire module of app

- @Differnce Between @HostBinding / @HostEventLisner : @HostBinding: This decorator binds a class property to a property of the host element. @HostListener: This decorator binds a class method to an event of the host element.

-----
-- Dependency Injection /  Services Provider Scope  -> Software design pattern that Deal with how component get hold with their dependency. - > root , Any, Platform.
-- Interceptor -  Interceptor c---------st. -  req - httprequest - request object to handle - next -nexthandle -any next interceptorin the chain, or no backend, if any remain interceptor in thechain. 	 	 
-- Services & Fectory --- Services and factory is just the wrappper of the provider , Will get instance (this.keyword)-will get vlue that invoking of func(retrurn value in factor)
-- Change Detection : changes detection means Updating the view (dom) when data has changed.
-- Behavior Subject  : behavior subject is called hold need to change the value nd shred the other components. - cmponents subscribe to data which is simply return data be.su whiout 
-- Cookies : Cookies: are assible and stored the session id from the server, session id will be sending during every api call.  4kb, security -> secure, httponly.
-- Angular Universal: Some time upto content get load / Angular server side rendering module for application in various scenrios.
-- Signleton? : a signleton is called to create signle instance of itself and to be created and give the access of created instance. two ways. application root / appmodule.
-- Virtual DOM / Regular DOM. : 
-- Promise And Observable : Promise object may be return signle value./ obesrable emit return multiple value over time.
-- Lifecycle Hook Angular.: constructor() ngOnChange() ngOnInit() ngDoCheck() ngAfterContentInit() ngAfterContentChecked() ngAfterViewInit() ngAfterViewChecked() ngOnDestroy()
-- httpClientModules : Provides types request and response objects. / intercept request response/ support observable API. / support striming error handling.
-- Angular Security? : 
-- angular module and javascript module
-- Tuple? Datatype 

 includes two set of value of different data types.
- Differnce betweeen Template Driven and ReactiveForm.


Try catch --- if facing error then skip move into another function show the error in console.

try{
} catch{
}

GlobalErrorHandler --> for common error handle.  -- provide in : add.

CanActive - only load with module and url - autorization
CanLoad  - if return true then module load with url autorization.
